# IPInfo Challenge

This is a series of challenges written in python using Unit Tests. These challenges are not for experienced python developers, but for beginners that have little experience in python. If you're looking for a challenge then you have come to the right place.

These challenges will teach you to make a simple project that will request JSON data from [IPInfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/json), you will also learn about exceptions, code coverage, CI, unit testing, classes, and a little bit more.

These challenges will _not_ make you an expert in Python, but it will force you to research on those subjects, try to learn about them, and make your own unit tests, experiments, add your own functionality and even **CHANGE** the behavior of these challenges!
